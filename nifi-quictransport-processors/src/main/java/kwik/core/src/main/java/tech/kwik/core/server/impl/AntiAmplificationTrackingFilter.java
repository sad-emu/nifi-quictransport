/**
 * https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-address-validation
 * "The primary defense against amplification attacks is verifying that a peer is able to receive packets at the transport
 *  address that it claims. Therefore, after receiving packets from an address that is not yet validated, an endpoint
 *  MUST limit the amount of data it sends to the unvalidated address to three times the amount of data received from
 *  that address. This limit on the size of responses is known as the anti-amplification limit."
 *
 *  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html#name-address-validation-during-c
 *  "For the purposes of avoiding amplification prior to address validation, servers MUST count all of the payload bytes
 *   received in datagrams that are uniquely attributed to a single connection. This includes datagrams that contain
 *   packets that are successfully processed and datagrams that contain packets that are all discarded."
