/**

 * "A receiver MUST discard a newly unprotected packet unless it is certain that it has not processed another packet
 *  with the same packet number from the same packet number space. Duplicate suppression MUST happen after removing
 *  packet protection for the reasons described in Section 9.5 of [QUIC-TLS]."
 *
 *  "Endpoints that track all individual packets for the purposes of detecting duplicates are at risk of accumulating
 *   excessive state. The data required for detecting duplicates can be limited by maintaining a minimum packet number
 *   below which all packets are immediately dropped. Any minimum needs to account for large variations in round-trip
 *   time, which includes the possibility that a peer might probe network paths with much larger round-trip times; ..."
